## 📌 Project Overview

This is a **complete, dynamic, and interactive Car Sales Dashboard** built using Power BI for a **leading car dealership** that needed real-time visibility into its sales performance.

The dealership had years of raw sales data but **zero ability to track live KPIs, compare year-over-year growth, or identify which car models, body styles, colors, and regions were driving revenue.** Every report was manual, delayed, and outdated before it even reached management.

I designed and built a **2-page Power BI dashboard** with advanced DAX measures covering YTD, MTD, and YoY metrics — giving the sales team and leadership **instant, real-time answers** to every critical business question.

---

## 🧩 Business Problem

> *"The car dealership's management team had no live view of their sales performance. Sales data existed in Excel files, but nobody could quickly answer: How much have we sold this year? Are we ahead of last year? Which car model is our best seller? Which region is underperforming? Leadership was flying blind."*

**The dealership was struggling with:**

- 📊 **No real-time KPI tracking** — no live view of YTD, MTD, or YoY numbers
- 📉 **No year-over-year comparison** — couldn't tell if 2023 was better or worse than 2022
- 🚗 **No model/body-style breakdown** — didn't know which cars were actually selling
- 🎨 **No color or style insight** — couldn't align inventory with customer preference
- 🗺️ **No regional visibility** — which dealer regions were over/underperforming was unknown
- 🏢 **No company-level tracking** — couldn't compare performance across brands
- ⏰ **Delayed reports** — by the time data was compiled, it was already stale

---

## 🎯 My Task as the Data Analyst

I was given the raw car sales dataset and tasked with building a complete BI solution:

| Task | What I Did | Tool |
|------|-----------|------|
| **Data Import** | Loaded raw car sales CSV into Power BI | Power Query |
| **Data Cleaning** | Fixed spelling errors, standardized columns, removed nulls | Power Query |
| **Calendar Table** | Built a custom date table for time intelligence | DAX |
| **Data Modeling** | Created relationship between fact table and calendar table | Power BI |
| **KPI Measures** | Built YTD, MTD, PYTD, YoY, Avg Price, Cars Sold measures | DAX |
| **Page 1 — Overview** | Weekly trend, body style, color, region, company grid | Power BI |
| **Page 2 — Details** | Full granular table — every car sale with all attributes | Power BI |
| **Interactivity** | Slicers for Body Style, Dealer Region, Transmission, Engine | Power BI |

</div>

## 🔍 My Workflow — Step by Step

### ✅ Step 1 — Data Cleaning (Power Query)

- Imported raw car sales CSV into Power Query
- Fixed **spelling mistakes** in car model names and body style labels
- Standardized date formats and removed incomplete records
- Created clean, analysis-ready columns for all categorical fields

---

### ✅ Step 2 — Calendar Table & Data Model (DAX)

```dax
-- Custom Calendar Table built with DAX
Calendar Table =
ADDCOLUMNS(
    CALENDARAUTO(),
    "Year",        YEAR([Date]),
    "Month",       FORMAT([Date], "MMMM"),
    "Month Number",MONTH([Date]),
    "Week of Year",WEEKNUM([Date]),
    "Quarter",     "Q" & QUARTER([Date]),
    "Day Name",    FORMAT([Date], "dddd")
)
```

Linked the Calendar Table to the main `car_data` table via a **one-to-many relationship** on the Date field — enabling all time intelligence DAX functions.

---

### ✅ Step 3 — DAX Measures I Built

```dax
// ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════
//              SALES KPI MEASURES
// ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════

// Year-to-Date Total Sales
YTD Total Sales = TOTALYTD(SUM(car_data[Price ($)]), 'Calendar Table'[Date])

// Month-to-Date Total Sales
MTD Total Sales = TOTALMTD(SUM(car_data[Price ($)]), 'Calendar Table'[Date])

// Previous Year-to-Date Sales
PYTD Total Sales = CALCULATE(
    SUM(car_data[Price ($)]),
    SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR('Calendar Table'[Date])
)

// Sales Difference (YTD vs PYTD)
Sales Difference = [YTD Total Sales] - [PYTD Total Sales]

// Year-over-Year Sales Growth %
YoY Sales Growth = DIVIDE([Sales Difference], [PYTD Total Sales], 0)

// Dynamic colour indicator for growth vs decline
Sales Difference Colour = IF([Sales Difference] > 0, "Green", "Red")

// MTD KPI Card Label
MTD KPI = CONCATENATE(
    "MTD Total Sales : ",
    FORMAT([MTD Total Sales] / 1000000, "$0.00M")
)

// ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════
//              AVERAGE PRICE MEASURES
// ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════

Avg Price       = DIVIDE(SUM(car_data[Price ($)]), COUNT(car_data[Car_id]), 0)
YTD Avg Price   = TOTALYTD([Avg Price], 'Calendar Table'[Date])
MTD Avg Price   = TOTALMTD([Avg Price], 'Calendar Table'[Date])
PYTD Avg Price  = CALCULATE([Avg Price], SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR('Calendar Table'[Date]))
Avg Price Diff  = [YTD Avg Price] - [PYTD Avg Price]
YoY Avg Price Growth = DIVIDE([Avg Price Diff], [PYTD Avg Price], 0)

MTD Avg Price KPI = CONCATENATE(
    "MTD Avg Price : ",
    FORMAT([MTD Avg Price] / 1000, "$0.00K")
)

// ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════
//              CARS SOLD MEASURES
// ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════

YTD Cars Sold   = TOTALYTD(COUNT(car_data[Car_id]), 'Calendar Table'[Date])
MTD Cars Sold   = TOTALMTD(COUNT(car_data[Car_id]), 'Calendar Table'[Date])
PYTD Cars Sold  = CALCULATE(COUNT(car_data[Car_id]), SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR('Calendar Table'[Date]))
Cars Sold Diff  = [YTD Cars Sold] - [PYTD Cars Sold]
YoY Cars Sold Growth = DIVIDE([Cars Sold Diff], [PYTD Cars Sold], 0)

MTD Cars Sold KPI = CONCATENATE(
    "MTD Cars Sold : ",
    FORMAT([MTD Cars Sold], "0")
)

// Max Sales Point (for highlighting peak on chart)
Max Point = IF(
    MAXX(ALLSELECTED('Calendar Table'[Week]), [Total Sale]) = [Total Sale],
    MAXX(ALLSELECTED('Calendar Table'[Week]), [Total Sale]),
    BLANK()
)
```
